## Building

To build SusScope, there are a number of dependencies that you must have installed on your computer. SusScope is built on Tauri, a rust application that runs web applications as executables.  

Do a `npm i` to install the node modules needed to run SUSscope. 

You also need to install Rust from [rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

To run SUSscope, open a terminal, navigate to the repository directory, and type `npm run tauri dev`.
